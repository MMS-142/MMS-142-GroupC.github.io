          <left> <p>Technological development is one of the most exciting things that can happen in the contemporary business world. It shakes up markets and makes business circles question which enterprises will succeed or fail when the moment arrives for new adoptions. Industry disruption spreads at a rate that has never been seen before. In this process, disruptive technology is crucial. <strong>Disruptive technology</strong> is a technology that has an impact on the functioning of the market or business. In some cases, new markets and values are generated by business models adapted to new technology. This triggers the disruption of well-established enterprises.</p><left></left>
<br>
    <left><p>Instead of traditional market-leading firms, disruptive technologies appear to be created by outsiders and founders in startups. Market leaders' economic environment does not encourage them to implement revolutionary technologies before they even emerged, because they are initially not successful enough and because their growth can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations (which are needed to compete against current competition). </p></left>

         Electronic commerce or internet commerce, popularly known as eCommerce, is the buying and selling of products or services online.
          It also refers to the transferring of money and data to fulfill the said transactions.
          <br>
          <br>
          Although the term eCommerce mainly refers to the sale of tangible products online, it also covers any transaction made through the internet.
          There's also a thriving Internet economy.
          E-commerce revenues are growing by 20% and 25% per year at leaps and limits, which suggest a significant shift in human consumers' buying habits.
          The Internet is to review convenience items and to receive current information on your search and specifications instead of telephone directories or yellow pages.

              <h1><center><FONT COLOR=white><strong>BENEFITS OF E-COMMERCE</strong></FONT></center></h1>
     <br>
      <p> According to an article published by the Amazon Services this 2020 showcases the advantages of e-commerce yet after reading this list we will be now discussing the reason why a good looking type of business DISRUPTS other businesses.</p>
     <br>
          <h2><FONT COLOR=white><center><strong>Low Startup Cost</strong></center></FONT></h2>
     <br>
             <p>A lot of aspiring business owners will get a chance to start their own brand at way lower costs if they go online, instead of the traditional business model.
            Business owners will save up on rental, utility, and material costs.</p>
     <br>
          <h2><FONT COLOR=white><center><strong>Potential to Earn Income 24/7</strong></center></FONT></h2>
     <br>
          <p>People can browse the internet 24/7, which means that online stores have the potential to earn money and get customers even during late hours. </p>
     <br>
        <h2><FONT COLOR=white><center><strong>Easy to Expand Internationally</strong></center></FONT></h2>
     <br>
            <p>For online store owners, it’s easier to launch products internationally because they only have to work out international shipping to be able to do so.</p>
     <br>
         <h2><FONT COLOR=white><center><strong>Comfortable Shopping Experience for Customers</strong></center></FONT></h2>
     <br>
            <p>Unlike in physical stores, customers will not have their privacy invaded by other shoppers and retail workers.</p>
     <br>
     <br>
        <h2><FONT COLOR=white><center><strong>Processing a Huge Number of Orders is Manageable.</strong></center></FONT></h2>
     <br>
            <p>Long queues don’t exist in eCommerce and online shopping sites are fully capable of processing hundreds and even thousands of orders at the same time.</p>
     <br>
        <h2><FONT COLOR=white><center><strong>Time and Money-saving Shopping Experience</strong></center></FONT></h2>
     <br>
            <p>Customers won’t spend gas money or fare if they shop online. The time they usually spend on traveling to a physical store will also be saved.
            We spend low operating expenses when we purchase from an online store; we have higher service quality and therefore extra costs will save us unnecessary costs.
     <br>
     <br>
  For instance, shipping costs are absolutely canceled if our goods or services are downloadable. More and more discounts and offers cannot be avoided for any online company, which is really nice for customers. </p>

      <h1 class="secTitle">Why and How Disruptive Technology Affects The E-Commerce?</h1>
      <div class="sec03__content">
        
       <p><FONT COLOR=white><strong> REASONS WHY IT CONSIDERED DISRUPPTIVE</strong></FONT></p>
       <br><br>
       <p> <strong>1. Exchange and sharing of information</strong><br>base on Evans & Wurster (1997) there is an extinction of traditional tradeoff and information exchange causing for it to reach businesses and consumer without the sacrificing the contents. <br><br>
           <strong>2. Digital assets as the input into the business transformation process</strong> <br> Rayport and Sviokola (1995), states that exploiting an internet must utilize and create its digital assets which is about the customers to give value in various disparate markets, as the revenue of every businesses is information. in short, to create a new business it is a must to reinvent customer relationship.<br><br>
           <strong>3. Cost transparency.</strong><br> this allows customers to know the data about the prices as well as the competitors. <br><br>
           <strong>4. Virtual display of merchandise.</strong><br>
            Unlike before a business finances the design and physical display of their product but since eCommerce allow new business to virtually put their product with enormous design, it tend to be more convenient causing the traditional business to lose more money where new firms prefer the conveniency and the cheap costs of shifting to eCommerce. <br><br>
           <strong>5. Speed and frequency of changes.</strong><br> in Digital economy the changes come so fast to the point whrere the businesses must know how to adjust and adapt like looking forward to the possible changes that are coming, knowing this gives advantages to a company. <br><br>
           <strong>6. Industry boundary.</strong> <br> traditional firms are transcends by the internet-based commerce, where a business structure or economy must give a peculiar solution that persuade every customers (flylib.com, n.d.)<br><br>
           
        <p><FONT COLOR=white>
           At quite a rapid rate, the industry is advancing. Technological developments are transforming the way we work, live, and do business. In technology, there are two forms of innovations: sustaining and disruptive. The technology that innovates successively from occasionally is sustaining technology. Disruptive technology is a newly invented technology that produces much more value than current technology and has the ability to change the way we operate, live, do business, and improve economic performance dramatically.
     <br>
     <br>
          It may take longer to create a disruptive technology than the current technology has taken and it entails more risk for existing technology, but it can achieve a quicker penetration and replace the technology that has been developed, leaving a significant impact.
      <br>
      <br>
          Disruptive technology changes a product that was generally so expensive and complicated that just a few individuals with a considerable measure of resources had access to it. Disruptive technology makes it more open and affordable to a much bigger population. At a point when the innovation that has the potential to change an industry develops, established organizations mostly consider it to be unattractive: it's not something which their customers need, and its anticipated profit margins aren't adequate to take care of huge organization technology expense for it. Subsequently, this innovation gets overlooked (Meyster, 2020).
      <br>
      <br>
            After some time another organization manages to bring innovation to a new market. Once the disruptive innovation establishes, small scale innovation rapidly raises the technology’s performance on attributes of that of mainstream customers’ value.

         The retail industry has moved linearly, as with other industries, and business practices and experience in the past are largely obsolete. However, retail automation accelerates harder and longer than we expect.<strong>Technology plays a vital role and more of our day-to-day decision-making is influenced.</strong>
         <br>
<br>
<strong>Technological innovations such as 3d modeling, image recognition, augmented reality, and robotics are evolving and give distributors new ways to engage consumers and operate their company more efficiently, although their expenses continue to decline(Bhat, 2019).</strong></FONT></p>
